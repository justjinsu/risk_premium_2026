# Quantifying Climate Risk Premium in Major Infrastructure Projects  
## Case Study: Samcheok Power Plant

### Executive summary
Major infrastructure projects in South Korea, especially coal-fired power plants, are financed without fully pricing climate risks. National policies (Basic Plan for Power Supply, NDC, net-zero 2050) require declining coal dispatch and earlier retirement, while physical hazards (wildfires, droughts, water stress) already disrupt operations. Ignoring these risks understates costs and overstates viability, locking in carbon-intensive assets that conflict with investor security and national climate commitments.

### Intervention
We will build a framework to quantify the Climate Risk Premium (CRP) — the financing cost uplift when climate risks are priced correctly. The work links transition and physical risks to project cash flows, translates these impacts into financing terms (loan spreads, bond yields, equity return requirements), and produces two main outputs:
- Analytical report showing how climate risks raise financing costs and erode coal asset viability.
- Interactive, open-source model to test scenarios and visualize risk impacts.

### Audience and outcomes
- **Investors and lenders**: evidence that climate risks materially raise cost of capital for coal, strengthening the case to reallocate toward renewables.
- **Civil society**: credible, data-driven tool for advocacy to highlight hidden costs and influence policy.
Outcome: Properly pricing climate risks reduces the attractiveness of coal projects and emphasizes the relative resilience of renewables, informing investment and policy decisions.

### Objectives
Demonstrate how climate-related risks — policy/dispatch constraints and physical threats (wildfires, droughts, water stress) — increase financing costs and reduce viability for carbon-intensive utility projects. Apply the framework to Samcheok Power Plant with broadly applicable lessons for large infrastructure.

### Background
Korea’s decarbonization commitments (Basic Plan, NDC, net-zero 2050) mandate declining coal utilization and earlier retirement. Physical risks such as wildfires and drought-driven water stress already affect grid reliability and cooling availability. Yet project evaluations still underprice these risks, overstating coal viability.

### Climate risk assessment
- **Transition risk**
  - *Policy*: Decarbonization policies push coal out of the merit order and constrain operating life to ~25 years aligned with net-zero 2050.
  - *Operational*: Grid congestion plus zero-carbon dispatch priority (e.g., nuclear) limit achievable capacity factors (<30% vs historical ~50% and economic ~80%).
- **Physical risk**
  - *Wildfire*: Transmission corridor exposure drives outage probability; Monte Carlo simulations estimate expected annual losses from outages, repairs, and replacement power.
  - *Water stress*: Droughts and warmer intake water reduce reliability and thermal efficiency, increasing O&M and potential retrofit costs; capacity derating is possible.

### Financial risk transmission model
- Map risk drivers to cash-flow impacts (lower operating hours, higher capex/O&M, early retirement).
- Convert baseline vs risk-adjusted cash flows into expected loss.
- Translate expected loss into financing terms (loan spreads, bond yields, equity returns) to derive CRP.

### Decision support and deliverables
- **Analytical report**: Methods, findings, comparison with renewables, and financing implications for stakeholders.
- **Interactive model**: Web or open-source package with a spreadsheet-style dashboard for scenario testing.
