## Key Results

### Baseline Scenario (BBB Rating)
```
Overall Rating: BBB (250 bps spread)
Component Ratings:
  - Capacity: AAA (2,000 MW)
  - Profitability: A (9.06% EBITDA/Fixed Assets)
  - Coverage: BBB (2.59x EBITDA/Interest)
  - Net Debt Leverage: BBB (7.62x Net Debt/EBITDA)
  - Equity Leverage: A (233% Debt/Equity)
  - Asset Leverage: BBB (70% Debt/Assets)
```

### Aggressive Transition Scenario (B Rating)
```
Overall Rating: B (600 bps spread) ← 2-notch downgrade
Component Ratings:
  - Capacity: AAA (unchanged)
  - Profitability: B (-9.97% ← NEGATIVE!)
  - Coverage: B (-2.85x ← CANNOT SERVICE DEBT!)
  - Net Debt Leverage: B (999x ← TECHNICAL DEFAULT)
  - Equity Leverage: A (unchanged)
  - Asset Leverage: BBB (unchanged)

Rating Spread Increase: +350 bps (BBB 250 → B 600)
CRP Addition: +9,575 bps
TOTAL FINANCING COST INCREASE: ~9,925 bps (99 percentage points!)
```

### Investment Grade Loss
- **Baseline**: BBB (investment grade) ✅
- **All transition scenarios**: B (speculative/junk) ❌
- **Consequence**: Many institutional investors (pension funds, insurers) **cannot hold sub-investment grade debt** by regulatory mandate

## Methodological Comparison

| **Aspect** | **CRP Model** | **KIS Ratings** | **Merton-Moody's** |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Input** | NPV loss | Financial ratios | Asset volatility |
| **Method** | Expected loss → spread | Threshold grid | Structural PD |
| **Output** | Continuous spread | Discrete rating | PD → rating |
| **Granularity** | Continuous (any EL%) | Discrete (6 buckets) | Continuous PD |
| **Strength** | Climate-specific | Market-standard | Theoretical foundation |
| **Weakness** | Ad-hoc sensitivity | Discrete jumps | Data-intensive |

**Together they provide**:
- ✅ **CRP**: Quantifies incremental cost of climate risks
- ✅ **KIS Rating**: Maps to market-standard credit assessment
- ✅ **Merton-Moody's**: Provides theoretical foundation
- ✅ **Combined**: Shows both new climate impacts AND rating migration

## Policy Implications

### 1. Stranded Asset Risk
Climate risks can:
1. Reduce profitability (EBITDA becomes negative)
2. Impair debt service (EBITDA < Interest Expense)
3. Trigger rating downgrades (BBB → B, loss of investment grade)
4. Increase spreads dramatically (+350 to +9,900 bps)
5. **Render projects economically unviable and unfinanceable**

### 2. Financing Cost Explosion
```
Baseline:
  KIS Spread: 250 bps (BBB rating)
  Total Cost: 5.5% (3% risk-free + 2.5% spread)

Aggressive Climate Risk:
  KIS Spread: 600 bps (B rating, +350 bps from downgrade)
  CRP Addition: +9,575 bps (climate risk premium)
  Total Cost: ~103% (3% + 6% + 95.75%)
```
**Project becomes unfinanceable at any realistic cost of capital**

### 3. Investment Grade Threshold
- **Critical boundary**: BBB/BB divide at N(R) = 4/5
- **Institutional constraints**: Many investors cannot hold BB or below
- **Market access**: Loss of IG status → loss of financing access
- **Systematic risk**: Climate transition → wholesale rating downgrades
