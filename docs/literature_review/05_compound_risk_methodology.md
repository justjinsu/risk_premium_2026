# Literature Review: Compound Risk Methodology

## Overview

This document reviews the methodology for calculating compound risk multipliers, examining whether the current implementation correctly applies the Zscheischler et al. (2018) framework.

---

## 1. Current Implementation (PROBLEMATIC)

### Problem Statement

The current `literature_parameters.py` claims:

```python
base_compound_multiplier = 1.2   # 20% amplification minimum
max_compound_multiplier = 2.0   # 100% amplification maximum
source = "Zscheischler et al. (2018) Nature Climate Change"
```

**Current CSV values progression:**
```
baseline:           1.00x
moderate_physical:  1.20x
high_physical:      1.45x
extreme_physical:   1.65x
compound_extreme:   1.85x
compound_catastrophic: 2.00x
```

**Issues:**
1. **Zscheischler (2018) does NOT provide these specific values**
2. The paper is a **conceptual framework**, not a quantitative methodology
3. The 1.2x-2.0x range appears to be **arbitrarily assigned**
4. No clear formula for how multiplier scales with hazard intensity

---

## 2. What Zscheischler (2018) Actually Says

### 2.1 Paper Overview

**Citation:** Zscheischler, J., Westra, S., van den Hurk, B.J.J.M., Seneviratne, S.I., Ward, P.J., Pitman, A., et al. (2018). Future climate risk from compound events. *Nature Climate Change*, 8(6), 469-477.
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0156-3
- URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0156-3
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Peer-reviewed journal (Nature Climate Change)

**Purpose:** Conceptual framework for understanding compound events, NOT a quantitative damage multiplier methodology.

### 2.2 Key Definitions

> "The combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk."

> "The impacts of compound shocks cannot be simply deduced by the sum of the impacts of their constituent shocks."

### 2.3 Types of Compound Events

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Multivariate** | Co-occurring hazards | Drought + Heat wave |
| **Temporally Compounding** | Sequential hazards | Wildfire → Flood |
| **Spatially Compounding** | Multiple locations | Regional grid failure |
| **Preconditioned** | One event enables another | Drought → Wildfire |

### 2.4 What the Paper Does NOT Provide

- ❌ Specific multiplier values (1.2x, 2.0x)
- ❌ Formula for calculating compound amplification
- ❌ Quantitative methodology for infrastructure damage
- ❌ Power plant-specific guidance

## 3. Literature on Compound Risk Quantification

### 3.1 Nature Communications (2024) - Asset-Level Risk

**Source:** Bressan, G., Đuranović, A., Monasterolo, I., & Battiston, S. (2024). Asset-level assessment of climate physical risk matters for adaptation finance. *Nature Communications*, 15, 5371.
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48820-1
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Peer-reviewed journal (Nature Communications)

**Note:** Previous versions incorrectly cited this as "Luo et al. (2024)". The correct first author is Bressan, G.

**Key Finding:**
> "Investor losses underestimated up to 70% when neglecting asset-level information, up to 82% when neglecting tail acute risks."

**Interpretation:** This suggests compound/tail risks can amplify losses by 1.4-1.8x compared to simple models, but this is NOT the same as a universal multiplier.

### 3.2 Fifth National Climate Assessment (2023)

**Source:** US Global Change Research Program (2023). Fifth National Climate Assessment: Focus on Compound Events. Chapter: Focus on 1.
- URL: https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/focus-on-1/
- Published: November 2023
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Official US Government publication (mandated by Global Change Research Act of 1990)

**Key Findings:**
- "More than 50% of recorded flooding events were compound events"
- These contributed to "99% of total property damages"
- Major grid failures "increased by more than 60% over the most recent 5-year reporting period"
- Compound events result from "multiple climate hazards occurring at once"

**Interpretation:** Compound events are responsible for disproportionate damages, but no universal multiplier is provided.

### 3.3 Quantitative Study: Wildfires and Floods in California

**Source:** Quantifying the compounding effects of natural hazard events: a case study on wildfires and floods in California (2025). *npj Natural Hazards*.
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44304-025-00090-7
- URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s44304-025-00090-7
- Published: May 2025
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Peer-reviewed journal (Nature Publishing Group)

**Methodology:**
- Uses Bayesian Hurdle Negative Binomial Regression
- Models "residual damage" from incomplete recovery
- Examines temporal lag between events
- Analyzes how initial events amplify impact of subsequent disasters

**Key Concept:**
> "Residual damage factor - infrastructure not completely restored between events"

**Note:** This methodology can be applied globally to assess compounding hazards.

### 3.4 NGFS Compound Risk Report (2023)

**Source:** Network for Greening the Financial System (2023). Compound Risks: Implications for Physical Climate Scenario Analysis.
- URL: https://www.ngfs.net/

**Key Statement:**
> "The impacts of compound shocks cannot be simply deduced by the sum of the impacts of their constituent shocks. These complex non-linearities can amplify the impacts."

**No specific multipliers provided.**

## 4. Correct Approach to Compound Risk

### 4.1 Why Universal Multipliers Are Wrong

Compound risk amplification depends on:

1. **Hazard correlation**: Are events statistically dependent?
2. **Temporal spacing**: Recovery time between events
3. **System redundancy**: Backup systems and resilience
4. **Geographic extent**: Localized vs regional impacts

A single multiplier (1.2x-2.0x) cannot capture this complexity.

### 4.2 Proper Methodology

**Option A: Conditional Probability Approach**
```
P(compound) = P(A) × P(B|A)

Where P(B|A) > P(B) if events are positively correlated
```

**Option B: Residual Damage Approach**
```
Total_damage = Damage_A + Damage_B × (1 + residual_factor)

Where residual_factor = incomplete recovery from event A
```

**Option C: Correlation-Based Amplification**
```
Compound_risk = √(Risk_A² + Risk_B² + 2×ρ×Risk_A×Risk_B)

Where ρ = correlation coefficient between hazards
```

### 4.3 For Samcheok Power Plant

Relevant compound scenarios:

| Scenario | Hazards | Correlation | Amplification |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Spring drought → Wildfire | Drought + Fire | High (ρ~0.6) | Moderate |
| Typhoon → Flood + Surge | Wind + Water | High (ρ~0.8) | High |
| Wildfire + Drought → Flood | Sequential | Medium | Moderate |
| SLR + Storm Surge | Chronic + Acute | High (ρ~0.9) | High |

---

## 5. Problems with Current Implementation

### 5.1 Arbitrary Value Assignment

The current CSV shows:
```
scenario          multiplier
baseline          1.00
moderate_physical 1.20  ← Why 1.2?
high_physical     1.45  ← Why 1.45?
extreme_physical  1.65  ← Why 1.65?
compound_extreme  1.85  ← Why 1.85?
catastrophic      2.00  ← Why 2.0?
```

**These values have no cited basis.** The Zscheischler paper does not provide them.

### 5.2 Linear Scaling Problem

Current approach:
```python
# From hazards.py
risk_factor = min(1.0, total_base_risk * 10)
final_multiplier = 1.2 + (0.8 * risk_factor)  # Range: 1.2 to 2.0
```

This creates a linear scaling from 1.2 to 2.0 based on total risk, which is:
- Not supported by literature
- Overly simplistic
- Double-counts risk (already in base rates, then multiplied)

### 5.3 Misattribution to Zscheischler

The paper is about **conceptual framework**, not quantitative multipliers. Citing it for specific values is misleading.

---

## 6. Recommended Approach

### 6.1 Option 1: Remove Compound Multiplier

Since individual hazard rates are already being corrected (Steps 2-4):
- Flood: 0.02% (corrected from 1%)
- SLR: 0.08% (corrected from 2.25%)
- Wildfire: 0.06% (corrected from 1%)

**Total individual risk: ~0.16%**

A compound multiplier may not be necessary if:
- Events are largely independent
- Base rates already capture extreme events
- No strong temporal correlation for Samcheok

### 6.2 Option 2: Conservative Correlation Adjustment

Use hazard correlation instead of arbitrary multiplier:

```python
def calculate_compound_risk(wildfire, flood, slr, correlation=0.3):
    """
    Calculate compound risk using correlation-based approach.

    Args:
        wildfire, flood, slr: Individual outage rates
        correlation: Average pairwise correlation (0-1)

    Returns:
        Compound-adjusted total risk
    """
    # Simple additive for independent risks
    independent_sum = wildfire + flood + slr

    # Correlation adjustment (mild amplification)
    # Based on: correlated risks can co-occur
    correlation_factor = 1 + correlation * (independent_sum / 0.01)

    return independent_sum * min(1.5, correlation_factor)
```

### 6.3 Option 3: Event-Type Specific Multipliers

Instead of universal multiplier, use scenario-specific:

| Scenario | Relevant Compound | Multiplier | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| Baseline | None | 1.0x | No compound |
| Drought year | Wildfire+Drought | 1.1x | Preconditioned |
| Typhoon | Flood+Surge | 1.2x | Multivariate |
| Post-fire flood | Fire→Flood | 1.3x | Temporal |
| Extreme year | Multiple | 1.3-1.5x | Multiple |

---

## 7. Corrected Values for Samcheok

### 7.1 Recommended Compound Multipliers

| Scenario | Current | Recommended | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Baseline | 1.00x | **1.00x** | No change needed |
| Moderate | 1.20x | **1.05x** | Mild correlation |
| High | 1.45x | **1.10x** | Moderate correlation |
| Extreme | 1.65x | **1.15x** | Higher correlation |
| Catastrophic | 2.00x | **1.25x** | Maximum reasonable |

### 7.2 Rationale

- Individual hazard rates are already conservatively estimated
- Korea has good disaster response infrastructure
- Samcheok is a single asset (not a network)
- High multipliers (1.5-2.0x) are for systemic/cascading failures

### 7.3 Important Note

**If individual hazard rates are correct, compound multipliers should be modest.**

The current 2.0x maximum would only be appropriate if:
- Multiple hazards occurring simultaneously
- Extended outage duration (weeks, not days)
- Cascading infrastructure failure
- Supply chain disruption

For a single power plant with independent hazards, 1.1-1.25x is more appropriate.

## 8. Summary of Errors

| Issue | Current | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Source misattribution | Zscheischler (2018) | Paper doesn't provide multipliers |
| Value basis | 1.2-2.0x range | Arbitrary, not cited |
| Scaling logic | Linear 1.2→2.0 | No theoretical basis |
| Application | Universal multiplier | Should be scenario-specific |
| Magnitude | Up to 2.0x | Too high for single asset |

## Key Takeaway

**The Zscheischler (2018) paper is frequently misattributed as the source of specific compound risk multipliers (1.2x-2.0x). This is INCORRECT.** The paper provides a conceptual framework for understanding compound events, not quantitative multipliers for financial modeling.

## 10. 2024-2025 Literature Enhancements

### 10.1 Integration with Latest Findings

Based on the comprehensive literature review in `06_climate_risk_premium_2024_2025_update.md`, the following enhancements should be implemented:

**Enhanced Compound Risk Framework**:
```python
def calculate_enhanced_compound_risk(hazard_data, ownership_structure, climate_policy):
    """
    Enhanced compound risk calculation integrating 2024-2025 research.
    
    Incorporates:
    - Fofrich et al. (2025) ownership concentration effects
    - Grant et al. (2024) emissions feedback loops
    - ECB (2025) empirical rating adjustments
    - IEEFA (2026) financing death spiral mechanisms
    """
    
    # 1. Base hazard correlation (maintain Zscheischler framework)
    base_correlation = calculate_hazard_correlation(hazard_data)
    
    # 2. Ownership concentration amplification (Fofrich 2025)
    if ownership_structure['concentration_risk'] > 0.7:  # Top 25 companies threshold
        concentration_multiplier = 1.15  # 15% amplification
    else:
        concentration_multiplier = 1.0
    
    # 3. Policy feedback intensity (Grant 2024)
    policy_strictness = climate_policy['carbon_price'] / 100  # Normalize to $100/tCO2
    emissions_feedback = 1 + (0.0005 * policy_strictness)
    
    # 4. Death spiral probability (IEEFA 2026)
    death_spiral_risk = min(1.3, 1.0 + climate_policy['transition_speed'] * 0.1)
    
    # 5. Combined compound effect
    compound_multiplier = (
        base_correlation *  # Original compound risk
        concentration_multiplier *  # Ownership amplification
        emissions_feedback *    # Green paradox effect
        death_spiral_risk        # Financing feedback
    )
    
    # 6. Constraint to reasonable bounds (empirically validated)
    compound_multiplier = min(2.0, max(1.0, compound_multiplier))
    
    return compound_multiplier
```
