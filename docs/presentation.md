# Quantifying Climate Risk Premium
## A Case Study of Samcheok Blue Power

---

# The Challenge

- **Unpriced Risks**: Infrastructure projects face significant climate risks often ignored by traditional models.
- **Transition Risks**: 
    - Carbon taxes & pricing.
    - Early retirement policies (Coal Phase-out).
    - Policy shifts (e.g., 11th Basic Plan).
- **Physical Risks**: 
    - Wildfires disrupting transmission.
    - Droughts affecting cooling water availability.
    - Efficiency losses due to heat stress.

# Methodology

1. **Inputs**: 
    - Plant Parameters (Capacity, Efficiency, Capex).
    - Scenarios (Transition Policies, Physical Hazards).
    - Financing Data (Debt Structure, Market Rates).
2. **Risk Engine**: 
    - Applies penalties (Carbon Tax, Derating).
    - Adjusts Cash Flows (Revenue, O&M).
3. **Outputs**: 
    - **Financial Metrics**: NPV, IRR, DSCR, LLCR.
    - **Risk Metrics**: Expected Loss, CRP (Spread Impact).

# Case Study: Samcheok Blue Power

- **Asset**: 2,100 MW Ultra-Supercritical Coal Power Plant.
- **Significance**: The last coal plant built in South Korea.
- **Status**: Commercial Operation started in 2024.
- **Investment**: ~4.9 Trillion KRW.
- **Key Risk**: **Stranded Asset Risk** due to accelerated coal phase-out targets (e.g., 2040).

# Scenario Analysis

We model multiple futures to bound the risk:

- **Baseline**: Business as usual (No climate impact).
- **Transition Scenarios**: 
    - *Moderate*: Aligned with current NDCs.
    - *Aggressive*: Net Zero 2050 (High Carbon Price, Early Retirement).
- **Physical Scenarios**: 
    - *Moderate*: RCP 4.5.
    - *High*: RCP 8.5 (Extreme weather events).
- **Combined**: Worst-case "Perfect Storm".

# Key Findings: Financial Impact

- **NPV Erosion**: Significant value destruction in Aggressive Transition scenarios.
- **Cost of Capital**: Climate Risk Premium (CRP) spikes, increasing financing costs.
- **Credit Rating Migration**: 
    - Quantitative assessment using KIS methodology.
    - Potential downgrades (e.g., AA- $\to$ A or BBB) due to deteriorated coverage ratios.
    - Risk of falling below Investment Grade in extreme scenarios.

# Interactive Dashboard

Our Streamlit-based application allows stakeholders to:

- **Simulate Scenarios**: Real-time adjustment of risk parameters.
- **Visualize Impacts**: 
    - Cash Flow Waterfalls.
    - Capacity Factor Trajectories.
    - NPV Comparisons.
- **Deep Dive**: Drill down into specific financial years and metrics.

# Conclusion

- **Climate Risk is Financial Risk**.
- Ignoring these factors leads to mispricing of assets and capital.
- Our model provides the **rigorous, quantitative framework** needed for:
    - Accurate Asset Valuation.
    - Strategic Decarbonization Planning.
    - Resilient Portfolio Management.
